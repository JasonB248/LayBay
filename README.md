LayBay, created by Philip Potgoeter and Sebastian van Zyl, is a unique project that offers a user-friendly website-turned-exe program. The main purpose of LayBay is to provide customers with a platform where they can easily create and track active LayBay transactions.

Once a user logs in to LayBay, they are taken to the home page, which serves as the central hub for their LayBay activities. The program is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that customers can navigate through its features effortlessly.

LayBay simplifies the process of setting up LayBay transactions. Customers can easily create new LayBay agreements, specifying the desired items, payment plan, and duration. The program allows for clear and transparent communication between customers and sellers, ensuring a seamless LayBay experience.

Furthermore, LayBay enables users to track the progress of their LayBay transactions. Through the program's tracking feature, customers can stay updated on payment deadlines, monitor payment progress, and receive notifications when payments are due. This level of tracking and transparency helps customers feel confident and in control of their LayBay commitments.
